# Continuation Notes for Next Claude Code Session

## Current Status

We are on branch `dotnet-migration` working on porting SaplingFS from Bun/JavaScript to .NET 9.0 C#.

## What Has Been Completed ✅

### Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)
1. Created .NET 9.0 console project with proper structure
2. Added NuGet packages:
   - fNBT (1.0.0) - for Minecraft NBT format parsing
   - TextCopy (6.2.1) - for cross-platform clipboard access
3. Implemented core Models:
   - `Vector.cs` - Immutable record struct for 3D coordinates
   - `MappedFile.cs` - File metadata representation
   - `BlockMapping.cs` - Block-to-file mapping
4. Implemented Services:
   - `FileScanner.cs` - Recursive filesystem scanning
   - `ProcessManager.cs` - Cross-platform process/handle management
5. Implemented Configuration:
   - `CommandLineOptions.cs` - CLI argument parsing
6. Created documentation:
   - `SaplingFS/README.md` - Project overview
   - `DOTNET_MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md` - Migration feasibility analysis
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Guide for Claude Code instances
7. Project builds successfully: `dotnet build` ✓
8. Project runs: `dotnet run -- test_world` ✓

### Phase 2: NBT & World I/O (COMPLETE)
1. Implemented `Models/RegionFileCache.cs`:
   - Record type for caching region file bytes and checksums
2. Implemented `Services/WorldParser.cs` - Full port from `parseWorld.js`:
   - ✅ `RegionToBlocksAsync()` - reads .mca files, decompresses chunks, parses NBT into block arrays
   - ✅ `BlocksToRegionAsync()` - writes block arrays back to region files with NBT encoding
   - ✅ `ForRegionAsync()` - iterator for region files within bounds
   - ✅ `FillRegionFileCacheAsync()` - pre-loads all region files into cache
   - ✅ Region file caching with SHA256 checksums for change detection
   - ✅ Handles chunk location headers, compression (zlib), NBT parsing with fNbt library
   - ✅ Supports palette-based block storage and packed long arrays
3. Project builds successfully with no warnings ✓

### Git Status
- Branch: `dotnet-migration`
- Last commit: `a83c4f0` - "Initialize .NET 9.0 C# project structure for SaplingFS migration"
- Uncommitted changes: Phase 2 implementation (RegionFileCache.cs, WorldParser.cs)

## What Needs to Be Done Next 🚀

### Phase 3: Terrain Generation (AFTER PHASE 2)

3. **`Services/TerrainGenerator.cs`** - Port from `worldGenTools.js`
   - Global `ConcurrentDictionary<string, BlockMapping>` for mapping
   - `BuildRegionDataAsync()` - main terrain generation using BFS
   - `ForMappedChunksAsync()` - chunk iterator
   - Terrain smoothing and feature placement (trees, ponds, ores)

### Phase 4: Monitoring (AFTER PHASE 3)

4. **`Services/ClipboardMonitor.cs`** - Clipboard polling service
   - Use TextCopy library
   - Poll every 200ms for player position commands
   - Extract position and call raycasting

5. **`Services/BlockChangeMonitor.cs`** - Region file monitoring
   - Poll region files for changes
   - Detect block modifications
   - Trigger file deletion if enabled

6. **`Services/RaycastService.cs`** - 3D DDA raycasting
   - Port raycast function from `main.js:179-238`
   - Used to identify which block the player is looking at

## Important Technical Details

### fNBT Library Usage
```csharp
using fNBT;

var nbtFile = new NbtFile();
nbtFile.LoadFromBuffer(data, 0, data.Length, NbtCompression.ZLib);
var rootTag = nbtFile.RootTag;
var sections = rootTag["sections"] as NbtList;
```

### ZLib Compression (.NET built-in)
```csharp
using System.IO.Compression;

using var input = new MemoryStream(compressedData);
using var deflate = new ZLibStream(input, CompressionMode.Decompress);
```

### Key Algorithms to Port

1. **3D DDA Raycasting** (`main.js:179-238`)
   - Casts ray from player position
   - Steps through voxels to find first mapped block

2. **Breadth-First Terrain Generation** (`worldGenTools.js:185-366`)
   - Start at (0, 32, 0)
   - Expand outward, grouping by parent directory
   - Random suppression for organic shapes

3. **Terrain Smoothing** (`worldGenTools.js:373-435`)
   - Iteratively move lonely blocks to better positions
   - Convert grass to dirt when covered
   - Add ore veins randomly

## Project Paths

- **Root:** `/Users/lodorestiffler/Documents/Projects/codex/SaplingCS`
- **.NET Project:** `/Users/lodorestiffler/Documents/Projects/codex/SaplingCS/SaplingFS`
- **Original JS Files:** Root directory (for reference during porting)

## Environment Setup

The .NET SDK path needs to be added to PATH:
```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/share/dotnet:$PATH"
```

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build
cd /Users/lodorestiffler/Documents/Projects/codex/SaplingCS/SaplingFS
export PATH="/usr/local/share/dotnet:$PATH"
dotnet build

# Run
dotnet run -- <world_name> [--debug] [--path <path>] [--depth <n>]

# Test
dotnet run -- test_world --debug
```

## IDE Integration (NEW!)

The user has added JetBrains Rider MCP server integration. You now have access to:
- Open files in Rider
- Read/edit files through IDE
- Run configurations
- Set breakpoints
- Execute Rider actions
- View project dependencies

Use these tools to improve development workflow!

## Recommended Next Steps for New Session

1. **Start with WorldParser.cs:**
   - This is the foundation for all Minecraft world I/O
   - Critical for both terrain generation and monitoring
   - Study `parseWorld.js` as reference
   - Use fNBT library documentation

2. **Test with a real Minecraft world:**
   - User should provide a test world backup
   - Verify we can read region files correctly
   - Ensure NBT parsing works

3. **Then move to TerrainGenerator.cs:**
   - Port the BFS algorithm
   - Test terrain generation with small file sets
   - Verify blocks appear correctly in Minecraft

## Questions to Ask User

1. Do you have a Minecraft test world we can use for development?
2. Would you like me to use the Rider IDE tools for development?
3. Should we create unit tests as we go?

## Reference Files

- Original JS implementation: `main.js`, `parseWorld.js`, `worldGenTools.js`
- Migration analysis: `DOTNET_MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md`
- Architecture guide: `CLAUDE.md`

## Current Todo List State

The todo list was used for Phase 1 and all tasks are complete:
- ✅ Create .NET 9.0 solution and project structure
- ✅ Set up project configuration and NuGet packages
- ✅ Create Models directory with core classes
- ✅ Create Services directory structure
- ✅ Add .gitignore for .NET projects

You should create a new todo list for Phase 2 when starting.

---

**TL;DR:** Phase 1 foundation complete. Next: Implement WorldParser.cs for NBT/region file I/O. Use Rider IDE integration. Refer to parseWorld.js for logic.
